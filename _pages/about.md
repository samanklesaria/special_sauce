This blog serves a few different purposes.
1. Writing a blog post about a topic forces me to make sure I properly
understand it myself.
2. Having these explanations on hand helps my future self re-learn these topics (once that understanding fades into a groggy memory).
3. Hopefully, writing primarily meant for my future self will still be intelligible (even useful) to other Internet denizens as well.

While these posts have associated dates (describing when I first posted them), their content will not necessarily be static over time. As my understanding of a topic changes, I may substantially revise old posts far after their original publication date. With this in mind, new posts will likely be quite unpolished: recent content should be seen as an early draft.
